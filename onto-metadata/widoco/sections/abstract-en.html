<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This specification describes the Archive Metadata Model Ontology, an OWL ontology which (temporarily) defines a few archival metadata elements needed to describes archival document sources in different chapters of the Venice Time machine project. Our intention is not to pursue the definition of such vocabulary but to use standards defined by the community. In this respect, we intend to use the <a href="http://www.ica.org/en/egad-ric-conceptual-model">Records in Contexts Conceptual Model</a>, which validation should come soon.
