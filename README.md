# ontology-dhlab
Vocabularies developed and used in projects at the epfl-dhlab.

**onto-data-core** describes core elements which could/should be used in almost all information extraction projects dealing with text material.

**onto-data-common** describes common elements across different projects (e.g. specific entity types).

**onto-data-rel** focuses on the definition of relations (e.g. business and family)

**onto-metadata** focuses on the description of archival information.

Vocabularies are kept simple and will be/are used in conjonction with other already established vocabularies (e.g. the [Knowledge store core data model](https://knowledgestore.fbk.eu/ontologies/knowledgestore.html#Entity), the [Simple Event Model](http://semanticweb.cs.vu.nl/2009/11/sem/), [CIDOC-CRM](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/html/5.0.4/cidoc-crm.html), or [Records in Context](http://www.ica.org/en/egad-ric-conceptual-model)). 

Documentation, evaluation and publication are automatically handled via [OnToology](http://ontoology.linkeddata.es/about).
