<p>The Garzoni ontology describes the specific domain of interest of the archival document series <i>Accordi dei Garzoni</i>, kept at the <a href= "http://www.archiviodistatovenezia.it/siasve/cgi-bin/pagina.pl?Lingua=en"> State Archives of Venice</a>. </p>
<p> This document series contains about 55.000 apprenticeship contracts declared by guilds of various professions over an almost continuous two-century period (1575-1772). The working arrangements contained therein represent an important source of information to understand, amongst others, who was working where, for how long and how much, how workshops were organized and distributed over the city, which professions were taught and where apprentices were coming from. </p>

<h3 id="ns" class="list">The <i>Accordi dei Garzoni</i></h3>

Recorded over 32 registers by various different hands, apprenticeship contracts -- which are administrative documents -- report information in an extremely regular manner. This is of particular benefit for the task of data modeling, and the present ontology naturally reflects the pieces of information present in the contracts, namely:
 <ul>
 	<li>the identity of the involved persons, with the Apprentice, the Master, and potentially a Guarantor. Various information such as age, profession, residence or the geographical origins of persons are often mentioned. </li>
 	<li> the profession to be taught and the workshop where the learning takes place. </li>
 	<li> the diverse terms of the contracts, including: financial conditions (salary and pledge), hosting conditions (whether the master was offering the accommodation to the apprentice, or other advantages), and temporal conditions, with contract's starting date and duration.</li>
</ul>
