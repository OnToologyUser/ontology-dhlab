<h2>Abstract</h2><p>This specification describes the Garzoni Data Model ontology, an OWL ontology which encodes the necessary elements to represent data from the Garzoni project. </p>
<p>Led by an interdisciplinary consortium made up of historians, digital humanists and computer scientists, the Garzoni project undertakes the study of apprenticeship, work and society in early modern Venice by focusing on a specific archival source, namely the <i>Accordi dei Garzoni</i> from the Venetian State Archives. The project revolves around two main phases with, in the first instance, the design and the development of tools to extract and render information contained in archival documents and, as a second step, the examination of such information under different historical perspectives. More information on the project can be found on this <a href="http://dhlab.epfl.ch/page-127961-en.html">page</a> or this <a href="http://garzoni.hypotheses.org">blog</a>.</p>
